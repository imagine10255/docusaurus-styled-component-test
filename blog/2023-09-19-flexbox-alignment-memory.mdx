As a front-end engineer, I have never had a very systematic way to use `Flexbox alignment`. I often use `align-item-center` when I need to align to center, and if that doesn't work, I'll try `justify-content-center`. If that still doesn't work... well, it should be a parent container height problem.

It's time to come up with a way to remember it today.

## Main axis and cross axis

First, figure out who is the `main axis` and who is the `cross axis`

- justify-content control main axis alignment
- align-items control cross axis alignment


### Row 水平排列

`Row` is `horizontal alignment`, so controlling the alignment of the `main axis` is `horizontal alignment`.

### Column 垂直排列

`Column` is a `vertical layout`, so controlling the alignment of the `main axis` is the same as controlling the `vertical alignment`


<FlexboxColumnAlignmentMemory/>


## Finish

So we only need to remember that if the current `flex direction` is `flex-row`, then to center vertically, we need to control the opposite of the `main axis`. The cross axis is controlled by `align-item`. Conversely, if the current flex direction is `flex-column`, then to center vertically, we need to control the `main axis`. The `main axis` is controlled by `justify-content`.
