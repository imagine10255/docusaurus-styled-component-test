# Row

Gutter used to separate [Col](/docs/layout/grid-system/col) spacing

Rows are wrappers for columns. Each column has horizontal padding (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them. This padding is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins to ensure the content in your columns is visually aligned down the left side. Rows also support modifier classes to uniformly apply column sizing and gutter classes to change the spacing of your content.

You may find that we do not provide lower-level settings that support Row, similar to how Grid is used, where the container controls the allocation of items, because I hope it focuses on doing internal item allocation through `Col`


```tsx
import {Container, Row} from 'bear-react-grid';

<Container>
    <Row>
        {/*...ignore some */}
    </Row>
</Container>
```

:::caution Suggestion

Row itself will have left and right margins of gutter * -0.5

Row will add left and right padding to the bottom layer through the CSS selector: gutter * 0.5

***Do not manually change the `margin` left and right of Row, this will destroy the grid design***

***Also the padding left and `right` of `his lower layer`***

For example, using inline-style margin: 2px or utility class methods m-0 mx-2.

If needed, use the following methods to change the gutter.

:::


## 更改 Gutter

To replicate the margin and padding of Row and Col, use the `g-0` ~ `g-5` utility classes.


```tsx
import {Row} from 'bear-react-grid';

<Row className="g-2 g-md-3">
</Row>
```


:::danger Suggestion
Please note that it is not `gap-?`, because the lower layer of Row will be matched with Col, and Col will use % to allocate the width.

But % will not be included in the gap, so the version will run
:::

## 自訂 Gutter

If the `g-0` ~ `g-5` utility classes do not meet your needs, you can override the gutter variable.

```tsx
import {Row} from 'bear-react-grid';

const CustomRow = styled(Row)`
    --bear-gutter-x: 10px;

    ${media.lg`
        --bear-gutter-x: 15px;
    `}
`;
```


<SampleRow/>
